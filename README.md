Simply a Minecraft Server BAT
=====

A simple Minecraft Server bat that initializes 7z archiving for back up & starts Minecraft when using it. 
Nothing fancy really. Everything is dumb dependent command lines.


You'll need to have your server & Minecraft Launcher in the %APPDATA%/.minecraft/server folder for this to work. 

7-Zip Command Line Version is here: http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
Throw the EXE into your world folder.

Works with any Server version so far.
