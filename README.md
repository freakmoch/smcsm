Simply a Minecraft Server BAT
=====

A simple Minecraft Server bat that initializes 7z archiving for back up & starts Minecraft when using it. 
Nothing fancy really. Everything is dumb dependent command lines in cmd.

Works with any Server version so far.

### Features

 - Backs up server before starting server, and gives the option to back up after
 - Makes backups into randomized numbers and throws them into a /bk/ folder (Note: Do not eat backup burgers.)
 - Starts up minecraft from your server folder if `minecraft.exe` is present
 - White/Purple command background. You can change this with the color command.

### Required External Sources

 - Any minecraft_server.jar
 - A server thats already been run once.
 - 7-Zip Command Line Version: http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

Make sure to throw `7za.exe` into your world folder
